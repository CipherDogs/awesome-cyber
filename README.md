# Awesome cyber [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

cyber is a brand new protocol (a procedure that helps computers to do things in a certain way) for adding and searching information onto a knowledge graph (a compilation of facts about something that provides meaning to the user). And rank this information. In other words, it's a decentralized google.

This protocol exists thanks to such technology as blockchain and what is referred to, as content addressing (a way to locate information on the web using the content, rather than referring to its location, by such, avoiding censorship).
